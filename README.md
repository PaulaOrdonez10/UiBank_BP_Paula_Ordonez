Blue Prism Project - Bank Loan Application Automation:
Developed a Blue Prism bot to streamline the process of evaluating loan applications for a bank's website.
The bot retrieves Excel files via Outlook, filters the information to determine eligible loan applicants, and updates the files accordingly.
Upon completion, the bot sends the updated Excel files to the designated recipients.
